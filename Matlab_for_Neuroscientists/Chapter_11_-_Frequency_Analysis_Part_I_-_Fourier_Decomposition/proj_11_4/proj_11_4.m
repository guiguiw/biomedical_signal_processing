% 11.4 PROJECT
%     In this project, you will be asked to use Fourier decomposition to analyze vowel sounds
%     produced by human speakers. On the companion website, you will find five examples of
%     vowel sounds as produced by male American English speakers. Each sound corresponds
%     to one of the vowel sounds in Table 11.1. The formant frequencies in Table 11.1 note the
%     average formant frequencies as spoken by a male speaker of American English. You will
%     use power spectra of these sounds to classify the recordings as one of these vowel sounds
%     in the table.
%     To complete this project, you need to understand how formants relate to frequency
%     analysis. The human vocal tract has multiple cavities in which speech sounds resonate. As
%     such, most sounds have multiple strong frequency components. In classifying speech
%     sounds, the lowest strong frequency band is termed the first formant. The next highest is
%     termed the second formant, and so on.
%     Vowels lend themselves to a particularly simple characterization through their for-
%     mants. Typically, vowel sounds have distinguishable first and second formants. Table 11.1
%     shows first and second formants for four vowel sounds in American English. Thus, the
%     short “i” sound would have strong frequency representation at 342 Hz and at 2322 Hz.
