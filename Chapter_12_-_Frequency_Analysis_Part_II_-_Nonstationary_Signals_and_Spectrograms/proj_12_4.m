%     Typical sleep in human adults includes the well-known REM sleep as well as four well-
%     characterized stages of non-REM sleep, or NREM sleep. During wakefulness, alpha waves
%     dominate the EEG, in the frequency range 8 to 13 Hz. As the person enters the first stage
%     of non-REM sleep, the dominant wave type transitions from alpha waves to theta waves,
%     in the range of 4 to 7 Hz. This is the first stage of non-REM sleep.
%     The second and third stages of non-REM sleep are characterized by sleep spindles, at 12
%     to 16 Hz, and the appearance of delta waves, ranging in frequency from 0.5 to 4 Hz. The
%     fourth stage of sleep is characterized by a majority power distribution in the delta wave
%     band. The third and fourth stages of NREM sleep are also termed slow wave sleep, to
%     denote the prevalence of the low frequency delta waves in these two stages.
%     On the companion web site, you can find three EEGs from patients falling asleep. Using
%     spectrogram and any other frequency analysis tools learned thus far, try to determine
%     when the people enter each of the NREM stages of sleep.
