EXERCISE 12.2
    Examine the result of the spectrogram
    with varying window sizes for the follow-
    ing time series:
    .. t 5 0:0.05:1;
    .. X 5 [sin(5*t) sin(50*t) sin(100*t)];
    Try values ranging from 16 to 1024 for
    the Hamming window width. How does
    the representation change with different
    Hamming window widths? Why might this
    occur?
